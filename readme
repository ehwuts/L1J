About

L1J - Level 1 Jungle

The goal of this project is provide accurate accounts for various 
possible jungle starts as if actually playing them through. The 
same calculations could also be expanded to provide champion 
dps for various builds, but for now the goal of describing time 
and resource expenditures of a first clear is more than enough.

Last developed for version 5.6.1, this project tends to stall 
out while reimpleminting and verifying jungle data and mastery 
calculations for a new season. 
Making accurate calculations is further complicated by the absence 
of several statistics from the data provided in riot's api, as well
as the ingame effect of bonuses being an arbitrary ordering of flat, 
multiplicative, and additive percentage adjustments.
