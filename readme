About

Originally developed for version 5.6.1, this project tends to stall 
out while reimpleminting and verifying jungle data and mastery 
calculations for a new season. 
Making accurate calculations is further complicated by the absence 
of several statistics from the data provided in riot's api, as well
as the ingame effect of bonuses being an arbitrary ordering of 
flat, multiplicative, and additive percentage adjustments.
